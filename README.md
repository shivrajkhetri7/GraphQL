## Description

This project demonstrates how to set up a GraphQL API with Express and Mongoose for handling user data. It provides functionality to create, read, update, and delete users.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- MongoDB (for database)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shivrajkhetri7/GraphQL.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd graphql-project
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your MongoDB connection string:

   ```plaintext
   MONGO_URL=mongodb://<username>:<password>@localhost:27017/yourdbname
   PORT=8000
   ```

## API Endpoints

The API provides the following endpoints for user management:

### Queries

- **Get a User by ID**

  ```graphql
  query {
      getUser(id: "USER_ID") {
          id
          name
          email
      }
  }
  ```

- **Get All Users**

  ```graphql
  query {
      getUsers {
          id
          name
          email
      }
  }
  ```

### Mutations

- **Create a User**

  ```graphql
  mutation {
      createUser(name: "John Doe", email: "john@example.com", password: "password123") {
          id
          name
          email
      }
  }
  ```

- **Update a User**

  ```graphql
  mutation {
      updateUser(id: "USER_ID", name: "Jane Doe", email: "jane@example.com", password: "newpassword123") {
          id
          name
          email
      }
  }
  ```

- **Delete a User**

  ```graphql
  mutation {
      deleteUser(id: "USER_ID") {
          id
          name
          email
      }
  }
  ```

## Usage

To start the application, run the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

For development mode with automatic restarts on file changes, use:

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

Once the server is running, you can access the GraphQL API at `http://localhost:8000/`.

## Scripts

- **`npm start`**: Starts the application in production mode.
- **`npm run start:dev`**: Starts the application in development mode with `nodemon`.
